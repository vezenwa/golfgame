Play Game class has the main method and GolfGame has the other methods that dictate the game. A round is completed after 18 holes have been made. Variable ‘score’ keeps track of score after each hole while variable ‘total score’ keeps track of scores so far in the round up to the end after which 18 holes have been made. ‘score’ is the difference between par and the number of strokes made before making a hole while ‘total score’ is the difference between the sum of pars for a course and the total number of strokes made in a round. 

PS. If you want to hit the ball really far while in the fairway, try club 1 and power 10
